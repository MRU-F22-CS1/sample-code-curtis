This repo contains sample code from lectures for Charlotte's classes. 

You can clone it to your local computer and `pull` changes to get the latest updates, or if you're feeling adventurous you can create a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and [sync](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) it after each class.
