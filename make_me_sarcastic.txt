Exceptions
By now you've seen plenty of Runtime Errors

Sometimes often data from files or user input is not in the correct format

You can try to do an operation, then handle an Exception if it doesn't work:

read a number from the user as a string
while number is invalid:
    try converting input to number
    if that doesn't work:
        print error message
